# Corkiejp-notes-on-awesome-bluesky

Looking at [Awesome-bluesky](https://github.com/fishttp/awesome-bluesky) by [Fishttp](https://github.com/fishttp) and listing github and bluesky accounts associated with the utilities!
The list will not be categorised but additions made as I research the utilities.

## Utilities   
- [Sky Follower Bridge](https://www.sky-follower-bridge.dev/) | [Repo](https://github.com/kawamataryo/sky-follower-bridge) | [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/sky-follower-bridge.dev) - Browser add-on to find your Twitter follows and followers on Bluesky. Chrome is recommend, must regularly updated. You can also scan others followers and import lists from 'Xitter'

The below may or may not feature in awesome list!
