# corkiejp-notes-on-awesome-bluesky

**Latest utility added here!** - 'Bluesky Bookmarks PWA'!

Looking at [Awesome-bluesky](https://github.com/fishttp/awesome-bluesky) by [Fishttp](https://github.com/fishttp) and listing github and bluesky accounts associated with the utilities!
The list will not be categorised but additions made as I research the utilities. I'm mainly just listing utilities, I like and will probably use.

A guide I came across recently (perplexity.ai seach) [Debbie's Unofficial Guide To Bluesky](https://publish.obsidian.md/debbieohi/bluesky) by [Debbie Ridpath Ohi](https://publish.obsidian.md/debbieohi/contact) << See contact info on site. No I don't intend to do notes on it. An excellent guide! 

For people recently joining Bluesky [see this tips page](/morepages/Tips-Moving-Xitter-to-Bluesky.md).

**Note:** - I have started to use [Bluesky Permalinks](https://blue.mackuba.eu/skythread/?hash=permalinkblueskyposts) {#permalinkdidprofile & #permalinkblueskyposts)
on this list, if you come across a broken link please let me known by tagging [@corkiejp.github.io](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:qxlh6bohvep3taqhmtpipx4b) on bluesky or through other socials!

As excellent as 'Fishttp' list is I found it lacking in contacts for the developers, so you can contact them with bug reports, improvement requests or other reasons? I found myself searching for that information when testing out utilities. So hoping these notes will benifit others?

## Accounts to follow that add features to BlueSky
- [Listifications](https://bsky.app/profile/listifications.app) by [Dominik Picheta](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:blbktib4slim5ttdovyu7vii):- Follow to receive notifications whenever you're added to a starter pack, block list, feed or someone blocks you. **Note: - Notifications by DM's** , so you at least need to allow them to 'users I follow'!
 **But you don't need to leave them on!** Excellent tip from Listifications, [See here for instructions](/morepages/Bluesky-Chat-TIP-Listifications.md)

- [Likes/Reposts](https://goodfeeds.co/likes-media-reposts) by [Jerry Chen](https://bsky.app/profile/jcsalterego.bsky.social) - A feed of your liked/reposted content. Surprised that these features are not default in the app itself. Notice the bareness of a new account I created recenty!
