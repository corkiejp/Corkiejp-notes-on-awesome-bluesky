# corkiejp-notes-on-awesome-bluesky

Looking at [Awesome-bluesky](https://github.com/fishttp/awesome-bluesky) by [Fishttp](https://github.com/fishttp) and listing github and bluesky accounts associated with the utilities!
The list will not be categorised but additions made as I research the utilities.

As excellent as 'Fishttp' list is I found it lacking in contacts for the developers, so you can contact them with bug reports, improvement requests or other reasons? I found myself searching for that information when testing out utilities. So hoping these notes will benifit others?

## Utilities   
- [Sky Follower Bridge](https://www.sky-follower-bridge.dev/) | [Repo](https://github.com/kawamataryo/sky-follower-bridge) | [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/sky-follower-bridge.dev) - Browser add-on to find your Twitter follows and followers on Bluesky. Chrome is recommend, must regularly updated. You can also scan others followers and import lists from 'Xitter'

## Other utilities and sites to bookmark!
The below may or may not feature in awesome list!

- [Bluesky User Count](https://bsky-users.theo.io/) Official Bluesky user count! Compared to next item on list?
