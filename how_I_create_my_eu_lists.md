## I utilise [SkyFollowerBridge](https://www.sky-follower-bridge.dev/)

The SkyFollowerBridge by [Kawamata Ryo](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:hcp53er6pefwijpdceo5x4bp) which is an excellent utility to find your followers (on other platforms such as 'X',
'Threads', Instagram, TikTok and more to be devloped) on Bluesky.

But I'm have sidetracked here, What is very handy is the ability to **scan 'X' List and import** them to your bluesky account.

As video demostrating in this [Bluesky post](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:l3nkrpivwuvwuqduk3illkvf/post/3lgdq2nqci226).

Because I use that facility, It is easier for me to generate new lists every now and again for new bluesky accounts, than trying to scan through a large list and make additions of newer accounts. The downside is if 'X' accounts get deactivated I might loose earlier found accounts in the process. But as [ec.europa.eu](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oxo226vi7t2btjokm2buusoy) has started producing official lists, I may not need to produce my lists in the future.

When I generate a new list, I changed the name of it and marked it expired and link to new one in description of the old. Keeping 2 lists for the same info and deleting older ones.

The last list above is manually genrated by me, of accounts reported to be imposters to me, so I don't add them to the lists again. If you come across such an account on my lists, I would appreciate a tagged mention in a bluesky post. To get them removed. I belive that the bridge may filter out these accounts if they are labeled as such by Bluesky Moderation service?

## Beware of the **Scam Website** with '.com'!

If you see people posting that link in stead of **www.sky-follower-bridge.dev** please politely ask for them to post the correct link. 
You can read more about this by the [developer here](https://corkiejp.github.io/embedwriter.html?url=./Skywriter-Threads/Page%20by%20Kawamata%20Ryo%20_%20Scam%20Website.html)!

I created a [moderation list](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:qxlh6bohvep3taqhmtpipx4b/lists/3lg4y7tswpx2v) to highlight some peoples mistake and draw attention to it, please don't use it to block or mute them unless they are spaming the url. Also asked the Bluesky Moderation Service to label it as [Unsafe link](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:qxlh6bohvep3taqhmtpipx4b/post/3lg4zlp6ygs24).

## That's all for now!

This is my first draft of this and may think of more things to say on it. But I will leave editing it for now.
