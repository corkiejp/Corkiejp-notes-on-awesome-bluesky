# **IMPORTANT!** Correct method to link to your profile on bluesky!

This is especially true for personal/domain handles, Due to the **Bluesky BUG** where accounts are marked with 'Invalid Handles' your account link might not appear correctly for other users!

But will work with the default bluesky social handles in case your encounter the bug.

Instead of linking to a profile with: -
> https://bsky.app/profile/corkiejp.github.io

use in my case as an example:-
> https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:qxlh6bohvep3taqhmtpipx4b
