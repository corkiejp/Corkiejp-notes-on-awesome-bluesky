# Listifications Bluesky Chat Tip

I was educated on the use of Bluesky Chat by 'Listifications' with an excellent tip!
I should have took note of message in the settings for chat on Bluesky, easily overlooked.
You need to enable the setting to allow chats, but once you send at least once one message to the account.
You can turn the feature off again, so not to be swamped by spam DM's!
