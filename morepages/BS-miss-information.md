# Countering miss-information and bad assumptions made about 'Threadreaders'/'unroll bots'

First of  please understand your [PRIVACY](https://mackuba.eu/2024/02/21/bluesky-guide/#privacy) or lack thereof on 'Bluesky'/'AT Protocol'!

Allot of user's use these for personal use only and a means to #Bookmarks interesting threads for later reading on a different device.

Not everyone is out to exploit these utilities for personal gain/monetized them (more on that in thread)..

There was one self-righteous 'Karen' recently, who clearly did not research them properly and listed an example that hadn't been used since 2023!
So her post was just targeting the particular one she featured in first post.

Some what if's where mentioned! Example what if someone shares a personalized thread of woes and concerns.

For me personally, that sort of content is not in my interest/orbit/sphere/[Skircle](https://skircle.me/) of people I follow.

So not likely to come across that, even if i did and read them, I'm more likely to post a reply urging them to delete it and provide link to PRIVACY above.

To monetize something on the web, you would need a highly visited website and Bad Actors exploiting/plagiarising personalized content would quickly get a bad reputation and defeat the attempts of earning from doing so. Lack of understanding how the web works.

My own experimental github.io website, I use the services to share my own threads and occasionally to feature others and do so respectfully. I don't monetize on the site because I show people how to protect there privacy with [PrivateDNS](https://corkiejp.github.io/embedwriter.html?url=https://skywriter.blue/pages/did:plc:qxlh6bohvep3taqhmtpipx4b/post/3lexdcj4akk2k) ~ Example of my own thread!

That website is mainly a means for me to access content, I like across different devices, no analytics or capture of data on it to know if others use it.

I will finish this thread with a link to a thread of discussions on topics raised here, I communicate with developers of these utilities to improve them!
