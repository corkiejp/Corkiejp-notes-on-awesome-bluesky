# ðŸ“Œ Bluesky Bookmarks! Bookmarks!

Must be the most often requested feature to be added to Bluesky?

As platform doesn't have this feature built in!

There are third party methods to do so, but must of them are device/browser specific.

First method list here works across device/browser, but some people are reluctant to use it, publicly displayed.

## 'PUSHPIN' ðŸ“Œ

['Puskpin' ðŸ“Œ](https://bsky.app/profile/jaz.bsky.social/feed/my-pins) by [Jaz](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:q6gjnaw2blty4crticxkmujt) - Bookmarks! A feed of posts you've replied to with a ðŸ“Œ. Handy bookmark method as other external methods are limited to a device/browser! **Don't just drop a pin**, add some keywords to be able to search for it later.

## Private Bookmarks ðŸ”–

  - Bookmarks without ðŸ“Œ
    - To bookmark a post, click â€¦ below the post & send it via direct message to @bookmark.cool (Private Bookmarks)
    - The post will appear in the feed a minute later. Nobody else can see your bookmarks
    - To remove a bookmark, send it via DM to @bookmark.cool with `/delete` in the DM
   
Came accross this today (1/02) when searching 'bookmarks' to see if I could post about this page to let people known.

It should alleviate people's concerns about not publicly sharing things with 'PushPin' method. Although it has limitations to be account specific and not searchable. If you have more than one account been able to search for 'ðŸ“Œ keywords' makes it possible to search accross accounts. See screen shot above.


## Bookmarked Posts 
### by @bookmarks.bluecanary.dev ~ Via Labbeler and Reporting ðŸ‘Ž

As [Likes](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:vc7f4oafdgxsihk4cry2xpze/feed/likes) and [Reposts](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:vc7f4oafdgxsihk4cry2xpze/feed/reposts) are third party features found on [goodfeeds](https://goodfeeds.co/). I went looking to see if there was a bookmark option.

Found [Bookmarked Posts](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:w6yx4bltuzdmiolooi4kd6zt/feed/bookmarks), going by the description and guessing the steps involved to set it up, I was relucant to even test it, let alone feature it here. As it uses the reporting feature to create bookmarks in a feed, it also requires a good number of clicks to do so! **Note** Can't report your own posts, no bookmark for them unless you use an alt account to do so. ðŸ‘Ž Because better versions available on this page.

There is other Bookmark that utilise DM/Chat listed on [goodfeeds](https://goodfeeds.co/search?q=bookmarks), let me know if you want them featured on this page?



## Desktop Browser

Your desktop browser bookmarks is a method that doesn't get mentioned very often? As each post can be opened as a page in a new tab and bookmarked. If you have bookmark sync enabled in your browser, you may also have cross device usage, but would require using a mobile browser instead of the app.

## Desktop Utilities

A good few desktop utilities have a bookmark feature as part of them, listing few I'm aware of below, and may add more to this list if and when I come accross them. Some people will have their favourite utilities to use as the default method of access.

## Android Apps

Found this below app been promoted on reddit yesterday (30/1/2025) and it sparked my curiosty, normaly I give apps with subscription built in a pass, but as this is a popular requested feature, gave it another look and others might find it uesful?. Also it sparked the idea to create this page.

## Apple iOS and iPadOS

Got a suggestion for 'Skymarks' in a [reply to reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueskySocial/comments/1ifhnin/bluesky_bookmarks_my_known_methods_to_do_so/) I made about this page, \
**I haven't personally tested iOS apps** because I am an **android**/chromebook/**windows**/linux (last in the distant past) guy and don't have iOS devices, so can't test the apps.

| Developer | Tool | Support | Features/Description |
