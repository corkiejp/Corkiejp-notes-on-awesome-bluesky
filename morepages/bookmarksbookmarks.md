# 📌 Bookmarks! Bookmarks! Bookmarks!

Must be the most often requested feature to be added to Bluesky?

As platform doesn't have this feature built in!

There are third party methods to do so, but must of them are device/browser specific.

First method list here works a cross device/browser, but some people are reluctant to use it, publicly displayed.

## 'PUSHPIN'

['Puskpin' 📌](https://bsky.app/profile/jaz.bsky.social/feed/my-pins) by [Jaz](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:q6gjnaw2blty4crticxkmujt) - Bookmarks! A feed of posts you've replied to with a 📌. Handy bookmark method as other external methods are limited to a device/browser!

## Desktop Browser

Your desktop browser bookmarks is a method that doesn't get mentioned very often? As each post can be opened as a page in a new tab and bookmarked. If you have bookmark sync enabled in your browser, you may also have cross device usuage, but would require using a mobile browser instead of the app.
