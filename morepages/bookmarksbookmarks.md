# ðŸ“Œ Bookmarks! Bookmarks! Bookmarks!

Must be the most often requested feature to be added to Bluesky?

As platform doesn't have this feature built in!

There are third party methods to do so, but must of them are device/browser specific.

First method list here works a cross device/browser, but some people are reluctant to use it, publicly displayed.

## 'PUSHPIN'

['Puskpin' ðŸ“Œ](https://bsky.app/profile/jaz.bsky.social/feed/my-pins) by [Jaz](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:q6gjnaw2blty4crticxkmujt) - Bookmarks! A feed of posts you've replied to with a ðŸ“Œ. Handy bookmark method as other external methods are limited to a device/browser!

## Desktop Browser

Your desktop browser bookmarks is a method that doesn't get mentioned very often? As each post can be opened as a page in a new tab and bookmarked. If you have bookmark sync enabled in your browser, you may also have cross device usuage, but would require using a mobile browser instead of the app.

## Desktop Utilities

A good few desktop utilities have a bookmark feature as part of them, lising two I'm aware of below, and may add more to this list if and when I come accross them. Some people will have their favourite utilities to use as the default method of access.

  - [deck.blue](https://deck.blue/) ~ a TweetDeck-like client for Bluesky, can use 'mardown' to create list of links in skeets!

## Android Apps

Found this below app been promoted on reddit yesterday (30/1/2025) and it sparked my curiosty, normaly I give apps with subscription built in a pass, but as this is a popular request feature, gave it another look and others might find it uesful?. Also it sparked the idea to create this page.
