# ðŸ“Œ Bluesky Bookmarks! Bookmarks!

Must be the most often requested feature to be added to Bluesky?

As platform doesn't have this feature built in!

There are third party methods to do so, but must of them are device/browser specific.

First method list here works a cross device/browser, but some people are reluctant to use it, publicly displayed.

## 'PUSHPIN' ðŸ“Œ

['Puskpin' ðŸ“Œ](https://bsky.app/profile/jaz.bsky.social/feed/my-pins) by [Jaz](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:q6gjnaw2blty4crticxkmujt) - Bookmarks! A feed of posts you've replied to with a ðŸ“Œ. Handy bookmark method as other external methods are limited to a device/browser! **Don't just drop a pin**, add some keywords to be able to search for it later.

## Private Bookmarks ðŸ”–

  - Bookmarks without ðŸ“Œ
    - To bookmark a post, click â€¦ below the post & send it via direct message to @bookmark.cool (Private Bookmarks)
    - The post will appear in the feed a minute later. Nobody else can see your bookmarks
    - To remove a bookmark, send it via DM to @bookmark.cool with `/delete` in the DM
   
Came accross this today (1/02) when searching 'bookmarks' to see if I could post about this page to let people known.

It should alleviate people's concerns about not publicly sharing things with 'PushPin' method. Although it has limitations to be account specific and not searchable. If you have more than one account been able to search for 'ðŸ“Œ keywords' makes it possible to search accross accounts. See screen shot above.



## Desktop Browser

Your desktop browser bookmarks is a method that doesn't get mentioned very often? As each post can be opened as a page in a new tab and bookmarked. If you have bookmark sync enabled in your browser, you may also have cross device usage, but would require using a mobile browser instead of the app.

## Desktop Utilities

A good few desktop utilities have a bookmark feature as part of them, listing few I'm aware of below, and may add more to this list if and when I come accross them. Some people will have their favourite utilities to use as the default method of access.

## Android Apps

Found this below app been promoted on reddit yesterday (30/1/2025) and it sparked my curiosty, normaly I give apps with subscription built in a pass, but as this is a popular requested feature, gave it another look and others might find it uesful?. Also it sparked the idea to create this page.

| Developer | Tool | Support | Features/Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------------|
| [Lalit](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:tx4quzdjqbupsqasreq4qwph) | [blueskybookmarks.com](https://blueskybookmarks.com/) | Subscription to unlock more features | Android PWA for Bookmarks! See [Annoucement Bluesky post](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:tx4quzdjqbupsqasreq4qwph/post/3lgvw7iasjs2g) |

## Apple iOS and iPadOS

Got a suggestion for an app suitable for them in a [reply to reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueskySocial/comments/1ifhnin/bluesky_bookmarks_my_known_methods_to_do_so/) I made about this page, \
have to research it more and will probably share here soon.

## More + Additions?

If you aware of other methods to bookmark, or suggestions to be added to the list please tag me (@corkiejp.github.io) in a Bluesky post.
