# Bluesky lets you control your own moderation!

So why hand that control over to another user's Block list? Who can add accounts to the lists, for whatever reason takes their whim!

Had an encounter with an account last night, when I challenged their possible spreading misinformation on a service I like and use.

They had created a similar utility with a mimicked name and accused the original service of blocking accounts. 

Yes even accounts providing a service have the right to use moderation block lists to protect their service and their users.

When I challenged the account, they added me to their own moderation account and blocked me, which they had every right to do.
I returned the favour with an active list I already had, and created a more suitable named list later. But now on 4 lists of theirs as if one wasn't enough for them.

As said in my reply to their service, they are not getting of to a good start that would encourage TRUST in the service. Also the person boasts of having 5k blocks.

But from behind the block proceed to continue attack me and encouraged others to block me. 

I don't really care, because they are filtering out content, I probably don't want to see anyway. So the accounts sheep are welcome to their walled off echo chamber!

Reminder bluesky is public platform and anything you post as a thread/reply is open to be challenged, nobody is invading your replies to challenge you on possible misinformation.
