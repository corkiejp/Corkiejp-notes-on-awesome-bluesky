Often requested feature for Bluesky, is to be able to get notification of newest post fron you favourite accounts. 

Let me bring your attention to **BlueNotify: -** [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.austinwitherspoon.bluenotify) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/bluenotify/id6738239349)

Found out about this app from this youtube [How to Use Bluesky! ~ From Beginner to Pro!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr58OOIYjN4) which was shared on [r/BlueskySocial](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueskySocial/comments/1ik9rhs/ive_made_a_tutorial_on_using_bluesky/).

## Post Notifactions from @posts.listifications.app

From the same creator ([Dominik Picheta](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:blbktib4slim5ttdovyu7vii)) as the popular Listifications utility!

This is an early beta, in testing phase at the moment!

It is easy to setup by doing the following:- 
- Create a list of accounts you want to be notified about on your profile called “Post Notifications”! Not mod list!
- Follow [posts.listifications.app](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:hqrgcv22lmizozkplfuevpmw)
- Enable ongoing conversations from the account by sending a DM/Chat to it. No need to have chats open to everyone!
- On the list detail the reason for it in the description, so accounts don't block to get of the list. Ask them to tag you for removal!
- Having the list feed is a handy way to see the posts notified to your account.
- See below for details on the limitations of the notification system at present!

### Limitations of above!

- You at present get notifications from accounts with a large following only
  - "set up so that only accounts with 10k+ followers are eligible"
  - "it's only top-level posts. You won't be notified when people repost or reply to others."
- You don't need to have a large following yourself to use it.
- [Bluesky Thread](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:blbktib4slim5ttdovyu7vii/post/3lnsoc7nd322s) discussing it.

### How to find accounts that meet the criteria?

Use an analtyics tool of your choice to find the followers of yours that have a large following1

Recently came accross [Blueview.app](https://blueview.app/) by [Simon Holmes](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:x476ra5ygaolra5oggenmcsc) which gives that information.

I only began testing it and still have to find accounts to be notified of, that I haven't already getting notifications from on Bluenotify.
